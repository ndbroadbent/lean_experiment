\paragraph{Claim.}
This is in fact false. Let us try to find consecutive primes $p,q,r$ with
\[
a = pq < b = pr < c = qr
\]
such that $2a > c$, so as to force only a single multiple of $a$ (and hence of
$b$ and $c$) in a block of $c$ consecutive numbers.

The first such case is $p=7$, $q=11$, and $r=13$. We have
\[
c = 11 \cdot 13 = 143
\quad \text{and} \quad
\frac{c-1}{2} = 71.
\]
Furthermore,
\[
\operatorname{lcm}(a,b,c) = 7 \cdot 11 \cdot 13 = 1001,
\]
so let us consider the block of $143$ numbers given by
\[
[1001n - 71,\; 1001n + 71],
\]
where $n$ is some positive integer coprime to $1001$ to be determined.

To satisfy the given problem, we would need to find three distinct numbers in
this block such that their product is divisible by
\[
abc = 7^2 \cdot 11^2 \cdot 13^2.
\]

By our constraint $2a > c$, there cannot be another common multiple of two of
these primes within $7 \cdot 11 = 77$ of the central midpoint value $1001n$; i.e.\ we
require multiples of $7^2$, $11^2$, and $13^2$ in the block to be the three
numbers we choose, as $n$ is also coprime to $7,11,13$ and thus we cannot pick
up their squares from $n$.

Since $7^2, 11^2 < c$, this is possible for $7^2$ and $11^2$, but since
\[
71 \equiv 6 \pmod{13},
\]
to have a multiple of $13^2$ in the block it must be within
\[
[n \cdot 7 \cdot 11 \cdot 13 - (71 - 6),\;
 n \cdot 7 \cdot 11 \cdot 13 + (71 - 6)],
\]
i.e.\ within
\[
[13(77n - 5),\; 13(77n + 5)],
\]
and hence we need a multiple of $13$ in
\[
[77n - 5,\; 77n + 5].
\]

Modulo $13$, this interval is $[-n - 5,\; -n + 5]$, as $13 \mid 78$, which
modulo $13$ is also $[8 - n,\; 18 - n]$.

Now $n \in \{1,\dots,5\}$ gives that $13$ is contained in this interval, but
with $n=6$ we require a multiple of $13$ in $[2,12]$, for which there clearly
is not.

Hence, taking
\[
a = 7 \cdot 11 = 77 < b = 7 \cdot 13 = 91 < c = 11 \cdot 13 = 143,
\]
the block of $c$ consecutive naturals
\[
[6 \cdot 7 \cdot 11 \cdot 13 - 71,\; 6 \cdot 7 \cdot 11 \cdot 13 + 71]
= [5935,\,6077]
\]
does not include any three distinct numbers such that their product is a
multiple of $abc = 7^2 \cdot 11^2 \cdot 13^2$.
