'It's like trying to prove "the sky is blue" in a theorem prover - the formal system talks about syntax, not the physical world'

-----------

this proof will keep pushing the boundaries of the formal system to a ridiculous extent, purely for the sake of entertainment.

foundational inputs / axioms:

- "the sky" refers the visible portion of the sky directly above Paihia, New Zealand on exactly 2:58pm on the 13th of December 2025.
- it is assumed that there are no clouds in the sky.
- "blue" refers to a shade between cyan and indigo on the visible spectrum within a certain tolerance.
- "blue" refers to the color of light that the average human eye perceives as blue.
- we assume that the observer is not color blind
- the earth orbits the sun
- an epoch. e.g. position and rotation of the earth relative to the sun on 1st January 1970 at 00:00:00 UTC.
- the speed of light
- the physical nature of how light scatters in the atmosphere - subject to sub-proofs where feasible (see below)


sub proofs:

- if the rotation of the earth is a certain degree relative to the sun, then light will travel from the surface of the sun and scatter in the atmosphere above a certain point on the earth's surface.
- at exactly 2:58pm on the 13th of December 2025, the rotation of the earth is X
- if a ray of light is scattered in the atmosphere, then the color of the light will be determined by the wavelength of the light and the scattering angle.
- if a million rays of light are scattered in the atmosphere, then many of them that are that color will find their way to the observer's eye.

and so on.


THEREFORE, the sky is blue.
